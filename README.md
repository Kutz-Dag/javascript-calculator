Creating a JavaScript Calculator for a freeCodeCamp Project. The purpose of the project is to create a functional calculator using the React.js framework.

### The calculator should look similar to this:

### I used these languages to create this project
```html
<div>
  <p>HTML</p>
  <p>CSS</p>
  <p>JavaScript</p>
  <p>React.js</p>
</div>
```

> I used React.js as my JavaScript framework to create this project, along with HTML and CSS.

### What was the aim?
* The calculator should be functional
* The calculator should be built using React.js
* There should also be no errors, for example, 5 + 5 should equal 10, and not 55.
